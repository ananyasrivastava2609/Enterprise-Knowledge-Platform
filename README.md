# Enterprise-Knowledge-Platform using RAG

This project aims to build an enterprise-grade knowledge platform using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that enables users to query internal documents and receive real-time, document-accurate responses. The system focuses on reducing hallucinations by grounding LLM outputs strictly in retrieved document context and is deployed using DevOps automation for continuous integration and delivery.
